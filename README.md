Melon Bomber Resliced is a fork of melon bomber that plans to expand its replayability and moddability.

Resliced currently features the following:
* Two new abilities that don't change gameplay too much
* More maps!
* Enhanced Bot AI(its still pretty bad though)
* Some stuff has been opened up to allow for mods to add new content!
* Spaghetti code in some areas, please ignore.


# Things to keep in mind

Please note that MelonBomber Resliced is **NOT** an official fork or branch of Melonbomber. This is a fanmade continuation of the gamemode to add extra polish and content, as well as maybe revive the gamemode from its currently dead state. Updates may be frequent, or not frequent, or heck, maybe by the time your reading this MB:RS is LONG dead.

*The default Gameplay may change overtime*, of course, you are free to disable the majority of the extra features if you just want to play good ol fashioned MelonBomber.

Don't submit issues for bot AI. I already know its bad, I might occasionally work on it but bots are not a major priority. If you want to submit a bot PR, go ahead, as that means I myself don't have to do any extra work. However, please don't report issues about bots unless its a lua error, as those I need to fix.

The "API" is prone to change, so if you are making mods for Melonbomber Resliced, just check occasionally to see if your mod still works and you should be fine.
